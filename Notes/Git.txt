	GitHub Workflow
	_______________


	Working Directory -> git add -> Staging Area(temporary space to store changes) -> git commit -> Local Repo -> git push -> remote repo
	
	Step by step procedure
	 
	Step 1) First we write git init. It means git is initialize but not tracking anything. 
			It shows file as U - Untracked
	
	Step 2)	Then write git add filename or . for all files. It will move files into staging area.
			It shows files as A - Index Added. means now this file is added in staging area.
			It will create a hidden folder .git in working directory.
			
	Step 3)	Then we write git commit -m 'commit message'. It will changes in local repo.
	
	Step 4)	Then we write git branch -M main. It will change branch name from master to main.
			Because git's default branch name is master but github's default branch name is main.
	
	Step 5)	Then we write git remote add origin repo-name. It will link local repo to remote repo.
	
	Step 6)	Then we write git push origin main.It will push our changes from local repo to remote repo. If we use -u first time then we dont have to type origin main every time. git push will do the task.
	
	NOTE: 	If we change a file that is pushed in remote repo. It shows file as M - Modified.
	

	GitHub Commands
	_______________

	  To set username in Git globally
	COMMAND: git config --global user.name "rana-rashid-ali"

	  To set email in Git globally
	COMMAND: git config --global user.email "rashidrana092@gmail.com"

	  To get complete list of configurations in Git
	COMMAND: git config --list
	
	 	After creating repo,to intialize an empty repo in project folder run this command.
	 	It will create .git hidden folder in project folder. Its called local repo.
	 	The repo created on GitHub was called remote repo.
		COMMAND: git init
	
	 	To add project files in repo.
	 	. means track changes in current folder or all files in this folder
	 	If we want only to track changes in single file in repo then command will be "git add 	app.js"
		COMMAND: git add . 
	
	 	To store changes in local repo with a message detail that will be shown in remote repo.
		COMMAND: git commit -m 'first commit'

	 	To change branch name from master to maintenance
		COMMAND: git branch -M main
	
	 	To add code files into remote repo from local repo
		COMMAND: git remote add origin https: github.com/rana-rashid-ali/devops-projects.git

	 	To push code to remote repo
		COMMAND: git push -u origin main

	 	To restore or Undo changes if file is in working directory or in staging area by git add .
		COMMAND: git restore filename
	 	If want to undo on all files.
		COMMAND: git restore .
	 	If file is added in stging area
		COMMAND: git restore --staged filename
	
	 	To restore file if file is commited or code is pushed in remote repo.
	 	First we need to show all commits with their hash values. 
		COMMAND: git log
	  	Above command will show all commits hash values with details. 
	 	If we want only hash values of commits in one line. 
		COMMAND: git log --oneline
	 	To restore undo changes 
		COMMAND: git revert hashvalue of commit e.g git revert 5f6d27f8	
	 	NOTE: git revert will undo the change but will not delete it from commit history

	 	To restore or Undo changes and also delete it from commit history.
	 	--soft means delete it from commit history but keep it in staging area
	 	--hard means it will undo commits, disard changes from staging area also from working directory.
	 	If no flag is used then by default --mixed is used.
	 	In --mixed, It will undo commit and also discard changes from staging area.
	 	HEAD~1 means move pointer to one step back
		COMMAND: git reset --soft HEAD~1 

	 	To set configurations globally, we use global git config file in root directory. 
	 	If we want to set different configurations like username or email for different repo then we have to set configurations in that project's .git file.

	  We can give a custom or shortcut name to a command that is known as alias in .config file 
	 	go to .gitconfig file and type the following in that file. using nano .gitconfig command.
	 	[alias]
	 			st=status
	 	In above line, st is shortcut or custom name given to command status
	 	If we use git config --global then alias will be set globally and can be used anywhere
	 	If we use git config alias.b branch, It will set this shortcut to only that repo where .gitconfig is called now.
	 	git config alias.b branch means set b for branch 
	
	 	GIT Branches
	 	To get list of branches in repo
		COMMAND: git branch

	 	To create new branch
	 	Method 1:
		COMMAND: git branch branch name e.g git branch second


	 	To switch between branches
	 	Method 1(Old way):
		COMMAND: git checkout branch name e.g git checkout second		

	 	Method 2 (Recommended way):
		COMMAND: git switch branch name e.g git switch second		

	 	To create new branch and switch to new branch in one command
	 	Below command will check if branch is already exist then simply switch to it otherwise first create new branch then switch to it. 
	 	Method 1 (Old way):
		COMMAND: git checkout -b branch name e.g git checkout -b third		

	 	Method 2 (Recommended way):
		COMMAND: git switch -c branch name e.g git switch -c fourth		
	
	 	To delete a branch
		Commands: git branch -D branch name e.g git branch -D third

	 	To push data from second branch
		COMMAND: git push -u origin second
		
	 	To merge code from second to main branch.
	 	first switch to main branch
		COMMAND: git switch main
	 	Then merge second branch in main branch
		COMMAND: git merge second
	 	Then push the code to main branch
		COMMAND: git push -u origin main

	 	COMMIT command detail
	 	Use single commit for single feature. do not commit after adding one line.
	 	It is recommended to NOT ammend or change commit AFTER code pushed to Github. Because, it will create new hash value of commit.
	 	To ammend or change a commit on same commit (before code pushed)
	 	METHOD: 1 (Hard way)
		COMMAND: git commit --amend
	 	Above command will open in an editor where you can update commit
	 	METHOD: 2 (Easy way)
		COMMAND: git commit --amend -m 'Ammend command added'
	
	 	To clone a remote repo
	 	Method: 1(Recommended)
	 	It is recommended because by doing so, .git folder will also copied where all changes and commit are stored.
		COMMAND: git clone repolink.git
	 	Above command will create new folder by repo name and clone files in it
	 	If we do not want to create new folder and we have already empty folder then put . after command
		COMMAND: git clone repolink.git .

	 	Method: 2(Not Recommended)
	 	It is not recommended because by doing so, .git folder will not copied so we dont have all commits and changes stored in repo.
		COMMAND: download repo as zip
	
	 	To clone from a specific branch
		COMMAND: git clone --branch branch name  repolink.git e.g git clone --branch second repolink.git 
	
	 	To get latest changes in repo
	 	METHOD: 1( Safe and Recommended)
	 	git fetch will download latest changes but it will not merge with working directory
		COMMAND: git fetch OR git fetch origin 
	 	origin means repo	

	 	METHOD: 2( Not Recommended)
	 	git pull will download latest changes and automatically it will merge with working directory
		COMMAND: git pull origin main

	 	After using git fetch origin code will download but will not show in working directory. 
	 	use git status to check and verify latest changes are copied or not.
	 	after runnnig git fetch origin command. Now we have to merge downloaded code in working directory
		COMMAND: git merge origin/main	
	 	origin means remote repo and main is branch name	

	  How to deploy static pages in Github
	 	Step 1: Make sure html file name is index.html
	 	Step 2: Repo must be public
	 	Step 3: Go to Repo settigs then on left bar go to pages
	 	Step 4: Select Deploy from branch, Then select branch name like main. then hit Save button
	 	Step 5: Go to repo root folder and after some time yellow dot will turn into green check. 
	 	Step 6: Click on that dialoge, then go to Deploy from left bar. there will be live url of project.

	  NOTE: If we make some changes in code. then we dont have to redeploy. after pushing code. changes will automatically shown in live url.

	  How to deploy React App - Vite on Github using github pages
	 	Step 1: run this command to install github page in react project
		COMMAND: npm i gh-pages
	
	 	Step 2: Then go to vite.config.js file and add below code before plugins: [react()],
		CODE:  base: "/react-vite-app/",
	 	In above line, "react-vite-app" is github repo name

	 	Step 3: Go to pakcage.json and add below line above name: react project name. This step is required for deployment
		CODE: "homepage": "repolink"

	 	Step 4: then below script in package.json
	 	In below line, -d means deploy and dist folder will be created when we created this project's build. 
		 CODE: "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"

	 	Step 5: Then push the code to repo by using following steps.
		a)	git init
		b)	git add . 
		c)	git commit -m 'first commit'
		d)	git branch -M main
		e)	git remote add origin repolink.git
		f)	git push origin -u main
	
	 	Step 6: Then build the project by following command.
		COMMAND: npm run build

	 	Step 7: Now run this command to deploy dist folder on github pages. it will create a new branch in repo by name of gh-pages
		COMMAND: npm run deploy
	
	 	Step 8: Make sure that in repo settting then pages gh-pages is selected as branch under deploy from branch section 


	 	Git Diff Command

	 	Below command will show the difference or change that is made in working directory.
		COMMAND: git diff

	 	Below command will show the difference or change that is made is in staging area and still not committed.
		COMMAND: git diff --staged

	 	If we commit a code which means changes are saved in local repo but not remote repo yet and we want to see the diff between local and remote repo then following command will do so.
	 	Below command means show me the diff between local and main branch of remote repo
		COMMAND: git diff origin/main

	 	If we want to see the difference between two commits then following command will do so.
		COMMAND: git diff hashvalue hashvalue	e.g git diff b232d08 05d34b8

	 	If we just want to know the file name where changes was made then following command will do so.
		COMMAND: git diff --name-only	

	 	If we want to see the changes in colors or hightlight the changes with colors then following command will do so.
		COMMAND: git diff --color-words

	 	HOW TO SKIP GIT STAGING AREA

	 	Below command will commit all changes in all files
		COMMAND: git commit -a -m 'first commit'

	  If we want to skip staging area for a specific file then following command will do so.
		COMMAND: git commit filename -m 'commit message' e.g git command test.txt -m 'changes added in test.txt file'

		
	 	GIT Stash Commands
	
	 	git stash is used when we have to switch to some other branch and we do not want to discard changes and also not commit changes
	 	Then we use git stash command. it will store changes from last commit to current changes in a temparary space.
		COMMAND: git stash

	 	To view changes that are stored in stash 
		COMMAND: git stash list

	 	To retrieve changes from stash. 
	 	METHOD 1: 
		COMMAND: git stash apply
	 	It will apply changes from recent stash but keep the changes in stash memory also.	

	 	METHOD 2: 
		COMMAND: git stash pop
	 	It will apply changes from recent stash and remove the changes from stash memory also.

	 	To retrieve changes from a specific stash
		COMMAND: git stash apply stashindex 	e.g git stash apply stash@{1}	

	 	To clear all stash memory
		COMMAND: git stash clear

	 	HOW TO ADD PEOPLE OR COLLABARATOR IN YOUR REPO
	 	Step 1:	Go to repo settings and open COLLABARATORS
	 	Step 2:	Search by email or username and send them invitation

	 	HOW TO USE MULTIPLE GITHUB ACCOUNTS ON SINGLE SYSTEM
	 	Step 1:  remove existing github account from vs by following command
		COMMAND: git config --global --unset user.name
		COMMAND: git config --global --unset user.email
	
	 	Step 2:  delete existing account from Windows Credential Manager.

	 	Step 3:  Set new user name and email by following command
		COMMAND: git config --global  user.name "rashid"
		COMMAND: git config --global  user.email "rashid@gmail.com"

	 	Step 4:	To see git config list
		COMMAND: git config --list

	 	WHEN A COLLABARATOR WANTS TO PUSH CODE, HE WILL DO THE FOLLOWING steps
		Step 1:  CLONE THE REPO
		NOTE: COLLABARATOR will not use git init command. because its already done by team lead.
		Step 2:  GIT ADD .
		Step 3:  git commit -m 'commit message'
		Step 4:	 git push -u origin main           

	 	After COLLABARATOR's code push when team lead wants the latest code.then he will run following command.
		COMMAND: git fetch or git pull or git merge origin main

	 	IF WE ARE NOT ADDED AS COLLABARATOR IN A REPO AND STILL WANT TO ADD CODE IN THAT REPO 
	 	THEN WE SEND PULL REQUEST. STEPS ARE FOLLOWING: 
		
	 	****** FROM USER SIDE ******

	 	Step 1: Open that repo in which i want to contribute and then click on FORK option
	 	FORK will create copy of that repo in user's github account

	 	Step 2:	Now User will clone the forked repo from his account
	
	 	Step 3: Best way is to first create new branch for work by this command
		COMMAND: git branch -b checkout new-feature
	
	 	Step 4: then add the code in new branch
	
	 	Step 5: Then push the code in new branch by using following Commands
		COMMANDS: 
		1)	git add .
		2)	git commit -m 'code changes by user'
		3)	git push -u origin new-feature

	 	Step 6: Then click on COMPARE AND PULL option 

	 	Step 7: after entering title and description click on CREATE PULL REQUEST

	 	****** FROM OWNER SIDE ******

	 	Step 8: Click on PULL REQUETS tab in repo

	 	Step 9: Click on COMMIT to see changes 

	 	Step 10: Click on REVIEW CHANGES. here are three option 
	 	Option 1: Comment ( pass some comment on pull request but not accepting pull request)
	 	Option 2: Approve ( Approve changes and merging it in main branch of original repo)
	 	Option 3: Request Changes (tell user to first make these changes then pull request will approaved)


	 	GITHUB ACTIONS

	 	1)	Github Actions is builtin tool for CI/CD in Github.
		2)	Automate tasks like testing, building and deploying
		3)	Works like a Virtual Assistant for developers
		4) 	It automate builds and tests, Improve code quality, Auto-deployment

	 	GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW

		It is auotmated process that runs based on triggers/events
		Triggers are the action that are performing on repo.
		Workflows are defined using YAML files inside .github/workflows/folder.

		Key components of Workflow
		
		Event:	Event or trigger means what your workflow will do the task.
		Job:	Set of steps/tasks that execute inside runner e.g build, test, deploy	 	
		Step:	A single task in a Job
		Runner:	A virtual machine where we run our workflow
		
		Workflow execution flow
		
		Event Occurs -> Workflow starts -> Jobs execute in parallel(by default)
