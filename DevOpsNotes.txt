Roadmap or Concepts in DevOps
______________________________


1)	a) Version Control System(VCS)
		It is used to track changes in code. 
		Example: Git
	b)	Version Control System Hosting Platform
		GitHub,GitLab

2)	Linux Operating System
	Because DevOps technlogies use Linux commands to operate
	
3)	Containerization
	It is used to create a lightweight image in which application with its environment is packed.
	So, We can run that application in any environment.
	Example: Docker
	
4)	Cloud Providers
	These provide online storage, servers and other services.
	Example: Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

5)	Configuration Management
	Automation the setup or maintenance of system and software.
	Example: Ansible
	
6)	Infrastructure Provisoing
	To set servers and resources so, application can work automatically.
	Example: Terraform
	
7)	Infrastructure Monitoring
	To monitor reserved server and resources that was allocated in Infrastructure Provisoing.
	Example: Grafana
	
8)	Container Orchestration
	To manage multiple containers
	Example: Kubernetes
