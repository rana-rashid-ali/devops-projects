	Roadmap or Concepts in DevOps
	______________________________


	1)	a) Version Control System(VCS)
		It is used to track changes in code. 
		Example: Git
	b)	Version Control System Hosting Platform
		GitHub,GitLab

	2)	Linux Operating System
		Because DevOps technlogies use Linux commands to operate
	
	3)	Containerization
		It is used to create a lightweight image in which application with its environment is packed.So, We can run that application in any environment.
		Example: Docker
	
	4)	Cloud Providers
		These provide online storage, servers and other services.
		Example: Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

	5)	Configuration Management
		Automation the setup or maintenance of system and software.
		Example: Ansible
	
	6)	Infrastructure Provisoing
		To set servers and resources so, application can work automatically.
		Example: Terraform
	
	7)	Infrastructure Monitoring
		To monitor reserved server and resources that was allocated in Infrastructure Provisoing.
		Example: Grafana
	
	8)	Container Orchestration
		To manage multiple containers
		Example: Kubernetes

	GitHub Commands
	_______________

	// To set username in Git globally
	COMMAND: git config --global user.name "rana-rashid-ali"

	// To set email in Git globally
	COMMAND: git config --global user.email "rashidrana092@gmail.com"

	// To get complete list of configurations in Git
	COMMAND: git config --list
	
	//	After creating repo,to intialize an empty repo in project folder run this command.
	//	It will create .git hidden folder in project folder. Its called local repo.
	//	The repo created on GitHub was called remote repo.
		COMMAND: git init
	
	//	To add project files in repo.
	//	. means track changes in current folder or all files in this folder
	//	If we want only to track changes in single file in repo then command will be "git add 	app.js"
		COMMAND: git add . 
	
	//	To store changes in local repo with a message detail that will be shown in remote repo.
		COMMAND: git commit -m 'first commit'

	//	To change branch name from master to maintenance
		COMMAND: git branch -M main
	
	//	To add code files into remote repo from local repo
		COMMAND: git remote add origin https://github.com/rana-rashid-ali/devops-projects.git

	//	To push code to remote repo
		COMMAND: git push -u origin main

	//	To restore or Undo changes if file is in working directory or in staging area by git add .
		COMMAND: git restore filename
	//	If want to undo on all files.
		COMMAND: git restore .
	//	If file is added in stging area
		COMMAND: git restore --staged filename
	
	//	To restore file if file is commited or code is pushed in remote repo.
	//	First we need to show all commits with their hash values. 
		COMMAND: git log
	// 	Above command will show all commits hash values with details. 
	//	If we want only hash values of commits in one line. 
		COMMAND: git log --oneline
	//	To restore undo changes 
		COMMAND: git revert hashvalue of commit e.g git revert 5f6d27f8	
	//	NOTE: git revert will undo the change but will not delete it from commit history

	//	To restore or Undo changes and also delete it from commit history.
	//	--soft means delete it from commit history but keep it in staging area
	//	--hard means it will undo commits, disard changes from staging area also from working directory.
	//	If no flag is used then by default --mixed is used.
	//	In --mixed, It will undo commit and also discard changes from staging area.
	//	HEAD~1 means move pointer to one step back
		COMMAND: git reset --soft HEAD~1 

	//	To set configurations globally, we use global git config file in root directory. 
	//	If we want to set different configurations like username or email for different repo then we have to set configurations in that project's .git file.

	// We can give a custom or shortcut name to a command that is known as alias in .config file 
	//	go to .gitconfig file and type the following in that file. using nano .gitconfig command.
	//	[alias]
	//			st=status
	//	In above line, st is shortcut or custom name given to command status
	//	If we use git config --global then alias will be set globally and can be used anywhere
	//	If we use git config alias.b branch, It will set this shortcut to only that repo where .gitconfig is called now.
	//	git config alias.b branch means set b for branch 
	
	//	GIT Branches
	//	To get list of branches in repo
		COMMAND: git branch

	//	To create new branch
	//	Method 1:
		COMMAND: git branch branch name e.g git branch second


	//	To switch between branches
	//	Method 1(Old way):
		COMMAND: git checkout branch name e.g git checkout second		

	//	Method 2 (Recommended way):
		COMMAND: git switch branch name e.g git switch second		

	//	To create new branch and switch to new branch in one command
	//	Below command will check if branch is already exist then simply switch to it otherwise first create new branch then switch to it. 
	//	Method 1 (Old way):
		COMMAND: git checkout -b branch name e.g git checkout -b third		

	//	Method 2 (Recommended way):
		COMMAND: git switch -c branch name e.g git switch -c fourth		
	
	//	To delete a branch
		Commands: git branch -D branch name e.g git branch -D third

	//	To push data from second branch
		COMMAND: git push -u origin second
		
	//	To merge code from second to main branch.
	//	first switch to main branch
		COMMAND: git switch main
	//	Then merge second branch in main branch
		COMMAND: git merge second
	//	Then push the code to main branch
		COMMAND: git push -u origin main

	//	COMMIT command detail
	//	Use single commit for single feature. do not commit after adding one line.
	//	It is recommended to NOT ammend or change commit AFTER code pushed to Github. Because, it will create new hash value of commit.
	//	To ammend or change a commit on same commit (before code pushed)
	//	METHOD: 1 (Hard way)
		COMMAND: git commit --amend
	//	Above command will open in an editor where you can update commit
	//	METHOD: 2 (Easy way)
		COMMAND: git commit --amend -m 'Ammend command added'
	
	//	To clone a remote repo
	//	Method: 1(Recommended)
	//	It is recommended because by doing so, .git folder will also copied where all changes and commit are stored.
		COMMAND: git clone repolink.git
	//	Above command will create new folder by repo name and clone files in it
	//	If we do not want to create new folder and we have already empty folder then put . after command
		COMMAND: git clone repolink.git .

	//	Method: 2(Not Recommended)
	//	It is not recommended because by doing so, .git folder will not copied so we dont have all commits and changes stored in repo.
		COMMAND: download repo as zip
	
	//	To clone from a specific branch
		COMMAND: git clone --branch branch name  repolink.git e.g git clone --branch second repolink.git 
	
	
	
	GitHub Workflow
	_______________


	Working Directory -> git add -> Staging Area(temporary space to store changes) -> git commit -> Local Repo -> git push -> remote repo
	
	Step by step procedure
	 
	Step 1) First we write git init. It means git is initialize but not tracking anything. 
			It shows file as U - Untracked
	
	Step 2)	Then write git add filename or . for all files. It will move files into staging area.
			It shows files as A - Index Added. means now this file is added in staging area.
			It will create a hidden folder .git in working directory.
			
	Step 3)	Then we write git commit -m 'commit message'. It will changes in local repo.
	
	Step 4)	Then we write git branch -M main. It will change branch name from master to main.
			Because git's default branch name is master but github's default branch name is main.
	
	Step 5)	Then we write git remote add origin repo-name. It will link local repo to remote repo.
	
	Step 6)	Then we write git push origin main.It will push our changes from local repo to remote repo. If we use -u first time then we dont have to type origin main every time. git push will do the task.
	
	NOTE: 	If we change a file that is pushed in remote repo. It shows file as M - Modified.
