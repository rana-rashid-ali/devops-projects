	Roadmap or Concepts in DevOps
	______________________________


	1)	a) Version Control System(VCS)
		It is used to track changes in code. 
		Example: Git
	b)	Version Control System Hosting Platform
		GitHub,GitLab

	2)	Linux Operating System
		Because DevOps technlogies use Linux commands to operate
	
	3)	Containerization
		It is used to create a lightweight image in which application with its environment is packed.So, We can run that application in any environment.
		Example: Docker
	
	4)	Cloud Providers
		These provide online storage, servers and other services.
		Example: Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

	5)	Configuration Management
		Automation the setup or maintenance of system and software.
		Example: Ansible
	
	6)	Infrastructure Provisoing
		To set servers and resources so, application can work automatically.
		Example: Terraform
	
	7)	Infrastructure Monitoring
		To monitor reserved server and resources that was allocated in Infrastructure Provisoing.
		Example: Grafana
	
	8)	Container Orchestration
		To manage multiple containers
		Example: Kubernetes

	GitHub Commands
	_______________

	// To set username in Git globally
	COMMAND: git config --global user.name "rana-rashid-ali"

	// To set email in Git globally
	COMMAND: git config --global user.email "rashidrana092@gmail.com"

	// To get complete list of configurations in Git
	COMMAND: git config --list
	
	//	After creating repo,to intialize an empty repo in project folder run this command.
	//	It will create .git hidden folder in project folder. Its called local repo.
	//	The repo created on GitHub was called remote repo.
		COMMAND: git init
	
	//	To add project files in repo.
	//	. means track changes in current folder or all files in this folder
	//	If we want only to track changes in single file in repo then command will be "git add 	app.js"
		COMMAND: git add . 
	
	//	To store changes in local repo with a message detail that will be shown in remote repo.
		COMMAND: git commit -m 'first commit'

	//	To change branch name from master to maintenance
		COMMAND: git branch -M main
	
	//	To add code files into remote repo from local repo
		COMMAND: git remote add origin https://github.com/rana-rashid-ali/devops-projects.git

	//	To push code to remote repo
		COMMAND: git push -u origin main

	//	To restore last commit OR Undo changes
		COMMAND: git restore filename
	//	If want to undo on all files.
		COMMAND: git restore .
	


	GitHub Workflow
	_______________


	Working Directory -> git add -> Staging Area(temporary space to store changes) -> git commit -> Local Repo -> git push -> remote repo
	
	Step by step procedure
	 
	Step 1) First we write git init. It means git is initialize but not tracking anything. 
			It shows file as U - Untracked
	
	Step 2)	Then write git add filename or . for all files. It will move files into staging area.
			It shows files as A - Index Added. means now this file is added in staging area.
			It will create a hidden folder .git in working directory.
			
	Step 3)	Then we write git commit -m 'commit message'. It will changes in local repo.
	
	Step 4)	Then we write git branch -M main. It will change branch name from master to main.
			Because git's default branch name is master but github's default branch name is main.
	
	Step 5)	Then we write git remote add origin repo-name. It will link local repo to remote repo.
	
	Step 6)	Then we write git push origin main.It will push our changes from local repo to remote repo. If we use -u first time then we dont have to type origin main every time. git push will do the task.
	
	NOTE: 	If we change a file that is pushed in remote repo. It shows file as M - Modified.
